Canadian Cases of COVID-19
==========================

I was trying to find a figure illustrating the changes in COVID-19 cases
with time for Canada and its provinces. I stumbled across a few but not
any with accessible databases.

I’ve compiled data from the Government of Canada website to help see the
change in confirmed cases with time. I’ll try to keep the database
updated at least once a day (but no promises!). My hope is that anyone
who is wanting to see how things have changed with time, or try to plot
their own graphs, will have an accessible resource to do so.

Source of Data
==============

All data has been collected somewhat-daily since March from the Public
Health Agency of Canada, Government of Canada. I’ve included a link to
their website in this repo. As their website states, provincial and
territorial reported numbers will likely be more up-to-date than what is
found on the PHAC website. Regardless, this gives a consistent idea of
how things are changing with time.

Where Can I Find the Compiled Data?
===================================

You will find two files:  
*canada\_covid.xlsx - Compilation of the data from the website in both
long and short form.  
*canada\_covid\_shortform.csv - A .csv file of the above that I like to
use to make graphs.

Graphs
======

Code to create these graphs can be found in the file ‘covid script.Rmd’.

Note: I chose to only focus on ‘confirmed cases’ that the PHAC website
gives.
