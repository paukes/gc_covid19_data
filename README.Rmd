# Canadian Cases of COVID-19

**Update:** The Public Health Agency of Canada now has updated their site to include accessible data (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html), as well as some additional graphs. Further, there is an excellent group that has developed a great open and informative interface, which can be accessed here: https://art-bd.shinyapps.io/covid19canada/.

As these resources are easily accesible, I won't be updating this Repo and suggest heading to those websites instead. Stay safe! 

*Previous Post:*

I was trying to find a figure illustrating the changes in COVID-19 cases with time for Canada and its provinces. I stumbled across a few but not any with accessible databases. 

I've compiled data from the Government of Canada website to help see the change in confirmed cases with time. I'll try to keep the database updated at least once a day (but no promises!). My hope is that anyone who is wanting to see how things have changed with time, or try to plot their own graphs, will have an accessible resource to do so.  

# Source of Data

All data has been collected somewhat-daily since March from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Government of Canada (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html). I've included a shortcut to their website in this repo. As their website states, provincial and territorial reported numbers will likely be more up-to-date than what is found on the PHAC website. Regardless, this gives a consistent idea of how things are changing with time.  

# Where Can I Find the Compiled Data?

You will find two files:  
* canada_covid.xlsx - Compilation of the data from the website in both long and short form  
* canada_covid_shortform.csv - A '.csv' file of the above that I like to use to make graphs

# Graphs

Code to create these graphs can be found in the file 'covid script.Rmd'.  

Note: I chose to only focus on 'confirmed cases' that the PHAC website gives. My hope is that this database helps others plot or visualize whatever they see fit.
