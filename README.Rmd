# Canadian Cases of COVID-19

I was trying to find a figure illustrating the changes in COVID-19 cases with time for Canada and its provinces. I stumbled across a few but not any with accessible databases. 

I've compiled data from the Government of Canada website to help see the change in confirmed cases with time. I'll try to keep the database updated at least once a day (but no promises!). My hope is that anyone who is wanting to see how things have changed with time, or try to plot their own graphs, will have an accessible resource to do so.  

# Source of Data

All data has been collected somewhat-daily since March from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Government of Canada. I've included a link to their website in this repo. As their website states, provincial and territorial reported numbers will likely be more up-to-date than what is found on the PHAC website. Regardless, this gives a consistent idea of how things are changing with time.  

# Excel Data

You will find two files:  
* canada_covid.xlsx - Compilation of the data from the website in both long and short form.   
* canada_covid_shortform.csv - A .csv file of the above that I like to use to make graphs.
